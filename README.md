Tableau_viz_ scraper
Here you can get a taste of the code I wrote in Python, 
in the case shown here I developed a Scraper which pulls data from dashboard that develop on Tableau software and displays the data in an Excel file that can be sent in a path to anywhere in the organization or other relevant sources.

Why do it? Very simple, Tableau developers perform their complex calculations on the dry data and therefore the software holds the calculated or interesting data and therefore in performing their retrieval/Scraping we can look at the calculated data not only visually from the great tableau software.
